# Closing Time

My local grocery store is open from 8 AM to 10 PM, from Monday through Saturday,
and from 9 AM to 9 PM on Sunday.

Amazon.com is a store. Why does it have to be open all the time?

This add-on makes it so that it isn't. Instead, it is open during the regular
business hours of the Amazon 4-Star store in the Soho neighborhood of New York.
If you attempt to access Amazon.com outside of business hours you will be
greeted with a friendly message.
